{partner-product-name} suite enables restaurant functions for medium-to-large enterprises across geographical regions. The Oracle POS suite relies on centrally hosted server applications that connect to distributed in-store clients for data and transactional needs. 

Retail enterprises have traditionally hosted central applications on premises using services that support connections from stores located in multiple geographies across time zones using a variety of local internet service providers (ISPs). This on-premises hosting option can cause several issues, including availability, latency, and scaling to support peak loads. 

In response, retailers are using the AWS Cloud platform to host {partner-product-short-name} workloads, with benefits including reliability, high availability, business agility, faster deployment time, and low latency.
